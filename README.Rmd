Welcome to notes (in the form of an RStudio project) from the workshop.

This file is `Rmarkdown` and you can open (and run) it in RStudio.
Although we didn't cover this format in the workshop, you can see it's a nice
way to combine text and code. (Perfect for reports.)


# First steps in R

below is some of the code we went through before creating this project

```r
# basics
1 + 100
2 + 5 * 3
2 + (5 * 3)
(2 + 5) * 3

# representing numbers
1 / 400
1 / 400000 
1e7
2.5e-6

# math funcutions
sin(3.14)
exp(1)
log(exp(1)) #natural log
log10(10)


# programmingy stuff

## variables
x <- 1 / 5
x <- 3
x <- x + 1 #updating a variable
# a = 2

## comparisons: true or false
1 == 1
2 == 1
1 < 2
1 > 2 
1 >= 1
2 <= 2
### danger: don't use == for floating point comparisons
0.99999999999999999999999999999999999999999999 == 1
all.equal(0.999999, 1)


## vectorization
1:5
2 * 1:5


# the environment
ls()
# rm('a') if you want to remove an unwanted variable


# the fun part --- using other people's code
installed.packages() #what do I have installed?

install.packages("Hmisc") # try to install "Hmisc"
```

# Workshop code

The rest of the code that we walked through in the workshop can be found
elsewhere in the project:
